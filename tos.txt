1.2	Goodgame Studios offers online and mobile games and other services within the context of its technical and operational capabilities, with an average annual availability of 90% (ninety percent).

Goodgame Studios is not liable for these instances in accordance with the conditions of this contract. This also does not include periods of time in which Goodgame Studios' general servers or the servers of certain games do not allow online access due to reasons beyond Goodgame Studios' control (force majeure, third party responsibility, etc.).
1.3	Goodgame Studios continuously updates, changes, and develops its online and mobile games and other services at its own discretion. Users can therefore only participate in the respective online game, mobile game, or other offer in its respective form provided at any given time. Goodgame Studios retains the right to cease operating an online or mobile game or remove a specific service without explanation.

In addition, specific terms and conditions shall also apply to certain online or mobile games, specific versions and/or components of online or mobile games, and individual services offered on Goodgame Studios' websites as appropriate. Users will be appropriately informed of any specific terms and conditions prior to use of the respective offer.
1.7	Users have the opportunity to use the services of Goodgame Studios' contractual partners for various online and mobile games and other services. In these cases, a separate contract between the user and the respective contractual partner of Goodgame Studios shall be concluded. Users will be informed of this in an appropriate manner prior to concluding the contract.
1.8	Other provisions or general terms and conditions of a user, which deviate from Goodgame Studios' general terms and conditions, shall only apply if Goodgame Studios gives prior written consent to their validity.

The use of several user accounts by one user is not permitted. Multiuser accounts such as these may be deleted or banned at the reasonable discretion of Goodgame Studios.
4.2	Users are prohibited from enacting any form of manipulative interference in online or mobile games. In particular, users are not entitled to utilize measures, mechanisms, or software that could interfere with the function or progress of the game.

Users are not allowed to block, rewrite, or modify content generated by the game administration or to interfere with the game in any other manner.
4.3	Under no circumstances may users
a) create or use cheats, mods and/or hacks, or any other third party software products that may change the result of the online or mobile games,
b) use software that allows the mining of data or otherwise intercepts or collects information in connection to the online and mobile games,
c) use virtual items that are being used in online or mobile games outside of the online or mobile games, purchase virtual items for "real" money, or sell or swap virtual items,

You may give chips to your buddies using the "send chips" tool. This tool is found by clicking on a picture of a buddy at the table or by viewing their profile page.

Doing so could result in your accounts being blocked or a chip penalty being stipulated at the reasonable discretion of Goodgame Studios.
b) Chip transfers
The only permissible method for transferring chips between accounts is the "send chips" tool (see Point a).  Losing chips on purpose (e.g. purposefully losing a poker hand at the table) in order to send chips to a buddy (or to yourself at another account) represents a breach of the general terms and conditions. Doing so could result in your account being blocked and a chip penalty being stipulated at the reasonable discretion of Goodgame Studios.
